Brief description

  A register machine as often used in theoretic computer science.  The
  concept is based on the Random Access Machine introduced in the book
  'Theoretische Informatik' by Alexander Asteroth and Christel Baier
  (ISBN 3-8273-7033-7).

Usage

  Import Ram from the module Ram.py and create an instance Ram
  ("filename") where 'filename' is the name of the file containing your
  program text, or run the module Ram.py with your 'filename' as command
  line argument.

  Program text is a plain text file.  Any line starting with a hash mark
  ('#') is ignored.  Empty lines MUST be avoided.  The first non-comment
  line MUST be a series of integer numbers denoting the initial values
  of your registers.  The first register (index 0) is also the
  accumulator and MUST be initialized with 0.  Program text MUST be
  entered as

    NUM COMMAND ARG

  where NUM can be anything (usually the line number for orientation),
  COMMAND is one of the accepted commands (see below) and ARG is the
  argument for COMMAND.  Anything following ARG up to the next newline
  ('\n') is ignored.

COMMANDS (see meaning of arguments below):

  LOAD k  :=  LOAD v(k) into accumulator
  STORE i :=  STORE contents of accumulator at register i
  ADD k   :=  ADD v(k) to accumulator
  SUB k   :=  SUBtract v(k) from accumulator
  MULT k  :=  MULTiply accumulator by v(k)
  DIV k   :=  DIVide accumulator by v(k)
  GOTO l  :=  GOTO line number l
  JZERO l :=  Jump to line number l if accumulator == ZERO (0)
  END ?   :=  set program counter to 0 (termination)

Arguments

  x     v(x)
  ------------
   k    reg[k]
  #k    k
  *k    reg[reg[k]]
